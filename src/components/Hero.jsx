            Welcome to this project dedicated to exploring React Routerâ€”a
            valuable library for managing navigation in React applications. This
            endeavor is a personal learning experience aimed at gaining
            proficiency in React Router concepts and implementation.
          </p>

          React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose
          declaratively with your application.
